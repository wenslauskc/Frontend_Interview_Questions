// WHAT IS STATE?
// - refers to the data that a component holds and manages.It represents the dynamic nature of a component and determines how it behaves and renders in response to user unteraction.
// - state allows components to store and update data internally
// - Stateless components/ functional components: these are plain JS functions. Do not have internal state management and do not use lifecycle methods. Receive data as props and use that data to render output
// - Stateful components / class components: have internal managed using the `state` object accessible via `this.state`
